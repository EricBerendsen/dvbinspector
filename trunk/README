readme

DVB inspector comes in a single .zip file. It contains all necessary files for running DVB inspector.

Unzip DVBinspector-0.0.5-dist.zip to a directory of your choice. It will create the following directory structure;

directory structure

    lib directory, contains jcommon-1.0.16.jar, jfreechart-1.0.13.jar, opencsv-2.1.jar. External libraries that are required.
    src/main/java, this directory contains sources for the java program.
    src/main/resources, contains images needed by DVB Inspector
    src/main/resources/res, contains comma separated resource files for bouquet_id, ca_system_id, data_broadcast_id, original_network, platform_id, oui_registration. The files can be updated if needed, see below.
    COPYING, contains the GPL license
    dvb.bat Dos command script that starts the program. Can be modified if libraries are placed in a different location than default. For linux/unix you have to modify it yourself. Should not be very difficult.
    DVBInspector.jar contains the classes for the main program. Can be executed using the dvb.bat script.
    DVBinspector-0.0.5.jar. Self contained jar that contains all resources and libs. To execute just double click.


DVBinspector-0.0.5.jar

Starting from release 0.0.3 there are now two ways to start DVBInspector. The easiest is to use DVBinspector-0.0.5.jar. This jar contains everything DVBInspector needs (apart from java), so there is no need to set class-paths, etc. On windows just double-click. Or from command line type "DVBinspector-0.0.4.jar" (without the quotes). If you want more control (to set heap size), and see some debug information you can use "java -jar DVBinspector-0.0.4.jar".
DVB.bat

This small windows batch file sets up the environment to start DVB Inspector. It includes the needed libraries in the class path, and -Xmx sets the maximum memory heap size to 1 GB. This should be enough to read fairly large TS files (> 200 MB). You can modify this file for other environments like linux.
