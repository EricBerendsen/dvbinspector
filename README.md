# DVB Inspector 

[DVB Inspector](http://www.digitalekabeltelevisie.nl/dvb_inspector/) is an open-source DVB analyzer, written in java. It can show the logical structure of the DVB SI and PSI data. It also shows bit rate usage data. DVB Inspector can be used to analyse contents; MPEG Video structure, teletext, DVB subtitles, DSM-CC Object carousels, SCTE-35 signaling, etc.

## Prerequisites

DVB inspector requires java 17 or higher.

## Installation

DVB inspector comes in a single .zip file. It contains all necessary files for running DVB inspector.

Unzip DVBinspector-1.18.0-dist.zip to a directory of your choice. It will create the following directory structure;

### Directory structure

*    lib directory, contains external libraries that are required.
*    src/main/java, this directory contains sources for the java program.
*    src/main/resources, contains images needed by DVB Inspector
*    src/main/resources/res, contains comma separated resource files for bouquet_id, ca_system_id, data_broadcast_id, original_network, platform_id, oui_registration. The files can be updated if needed, see [site](http://www.digitalekabeltelevisie.nl/dvb_inspector/installation.shtml).
*    COPYING, contains the GPL license
*    dvb.bat Dos command script that starts the program. Can be modified if libraries are placed in a different location than default.
*    dvb.sh Bash script to start the program using Linux.
*    DVBInspector.jar contains the classes for the main program. Can be executed using the dvb.bat or dvb.sh script.
*    DVBinspector-1.18.0.jar. Self contained jar that contains all resources and libs. To execute just double click.

## Usage

### DVBinspector-1.18.0.jar

There are two ways to start DVBInspector. The easiest is to use DVBinspector-1.18.0.jar. This jar contains everything DVBInspector needs (apart from java), so there is no need to set class-paths, etc. On windows just double-click. Or from command line type "DVBinspector-1.18.0.jar" (without the quotes). If you want more control (to set heap size), and see some debug information you can use "java -jar DVBinspector-1.18.0.jar".

### dvb.bat 

This small windows batch file sets up the environment to start DVB Inspector. It includes the needed libraries in the class path. 

### dvb.sh

The linux/unix/mac version of dvb.bat. This small batch file sets up the environment to start DVB Inspector. It includes the needed libraries in the class path.

## Manual

See the [manual](http://www.digitalekabeltelevisie.nl/dvb_inspector/usermanual.shtml) for more information on available views and options of the program.
