## Give a Star

The easiest way to show your appreciation is to give the project a star on Github. It encourages me to continue development.

## Thank You Email

A bit more personal than giving a star is telling me in an email what you use DVB Inspector for (amateur/professional, type of business,etc.) It does not have to be long. 

## I Have a Question

If you want to ask a question, did you first read the available [user manual](https://www.digitalekabeltelevisie.nl/dvb_inspector/usermanual.shtml)?

After reading the user manual feel free to open an [Issue](https://github.com/EricBerendsen/dvbinspector/issues). 

## I Found a Bug

Please check first that you are using the latest version of DVB Inspector. Then open an [Issue](https://github.com/EricBerendsen/dvbinspector/issues). 

### Before Submitting a Bug

- Please specify which version of DVB inspector you are using.
- Explain the behaviour  you would expect and the actual behaviour .
- describe the *reproduction steps* 
- Please provide a sample transport-stream 

## I Want to Suggest an Enhancement

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion / feature request for DVB inspector. Following these guidelines will help me to understand your suggestion.

### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [User Manual](https://www.digitalekabeltelevisie.nl/dvb_inspector/usermanual.shtml) carefully and determine if the functionality is already covered, maybe in a (context) menu.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince me of the merits of this feature. 
- Please provide (a link to) relevant documentation and/or a test stream.

## I Want to Contribute Code

When you want to fix a bug, or add a new feature/enhancement, and you already created the code for it, the rules above still apply. I still need documentation and/or test data to verify the correctness of your solution. 

The preferred method for contribution code is a pull request. When it is only a small change a .patch file may be acceptable. If you want to make a large change it is wise to contact me first, so we can discuss if and where your new feature fits into DVB Inspector.
