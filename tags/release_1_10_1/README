DVB inspector comes in a single .zip file. It contains all necessary files for running DVB inspector.

Unzip DVBinspector-1.10.1-dist.zip to a directory of your choice. It will create the following directory structure;

directory structure

    lib directory, contains jcommon-1.0.16.jar, jfreechart-1.0.13.jar, opencsv-2.1.jar, jlayer-1.0.1-1.jar. External libraries that are required.
    src/main/java, this directory contains sources for the java program.
    src/main/resources, contains images needed by DVB Inspector
    src/main/resources/res, contains comma separated resource files for bouquet_id, ca_system_id, data_broadcast_id, original_network, platform_id, oui_registration. The files can be updated if needed, see below.
    COPYING, contains the GPL license
    dvb.bat Dos command script that starts the program. Can be modified if libraries are placed in a different location than default. For linux/unix you have to modify it yourself. Should not be very difficult.
    DVBInspector.jar contains the classes for the main program. Can be executed using the dvb.bat script.
    DVBinspector-1.2.0.jar. Self contained jar that contains all resources and libs. To execute just double click.


DVBinspector-1.10.1.jar

Starting from release 0.0.3 there are now two ways to start DVBInspector. The easiest is to use DVBinspector-1.10.1.jar. This jar contains everything DVBInspector needs (apart from java), so there is no need to set class-paths, etc. On windows just double-click. Or from command line type "DVBinspector-1.10.1.jar" (without the quotes). If you want more control (to set heap size), and see some debug information you can use "java -jar DVBinspector-1.10.1.jar".

dvb.bat

This small windows batch file sets up the environment to start DVB Inspector. It includes the needed libraries in the class path, and -Xmx sets the maximum memory heap size to 1 GB. This should be enough to read fairly large TS files (> 200 MB). You can modify this file for other environments like linux.
java -classpath .;.\lib\jfreechart-1.0.13.jar;.\lib\jcommon-1.0.16.jar;.\lib\opencsv-2.1.jar;.\lib\jlayer-1.0.1-1.jar;.\DVBInspector.jar -Xmx1000m -Djava.util.logging.config.file=src/main/resources/logging.properties nl.digitalekabeltelevisie.main.DVBinspector

dvb.sh

The linux/unix version of dvb.bat. This small batch file sets up the environment to start DVB Inspector. It includes the needed libraries in the class path. Memory heap size  is not set, but you cvan add that option if needed.
